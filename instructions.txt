A large part of this was from this video on youtube by automation avenue, you can go through the link for more information, or if you need to setup things manually for yourself, the video may be of help.

Step 1 -> Find your machines ip address or domain name to access your services. We have Radarr, Sonarr, Jellyfin, Jellyseerr, Prowlarr and their ports are 7878, 8989, 8096, 5055, 9696 respectively unless you have different ports setup for you either in your compose file or a completely custom setup. This guide assumes you are using the default configurations for your whole setup, your mileage may vary if other methods are used.
As an example, we will assume this machine's ip address is 192.168.2.2, of course, this probably is not your machines address, replace that with your actual ip address anywhere you see that.

Step 2: Configure Prowlarr -> Visit Prowlarr on your browser with http://192.168.2.2:9696
-> authentication -> method = forms -> set username -> set password -> save -> add new indexer -> choose/search indexers (common indexers may be YTS, rutracker.ru, thepiratebay, therarbg) for each indexer, you can test before you save then close when done.
-> settings -> general -> backups -> backup folder = /data/backup/ (unless defined otherwise in your setup) -> save changes

Step 3: Configure Sonarr -> Visit Sonarr on your browser with http://192.168.2.2:8989
-> authentication -> method = forms -> set username -> set password -> save
-> settings -> media management -> add root folder -> /data/tvshows/ (unless defined differently in setup) -> tick create missing folders during disk scan -> save changes
-> settings -> download clients -> + -> torrent blackhole -> torrent folder = /data/blackhole -> watch folder = /downloads -> âœ” tick save magnet files -> save
-> settings -> general -> backups (press show advanced if you cant find backups section) -> backup folder = /data/backup/ -> ok -> save changes
-> settings -> general -> api key (copy api key)
(prowlar) -> Visit prowlarr -> settings -> apps -> sonarr -> prowlarr server = http://192.168.2.2:9696 -> sonarr server = http://192.168.2.2:8989 -> api key (paste copied sonarr api key) -> click test to confirm -> save

Step 4: Configure Radarr -> visit Radarr on your browser with http://192.168.2.2:7878
-> authentication -> method = forms -> set username -> set password -> save
-> settings -> media management -> add root folder -> /data/movies -> tick create missing folders during disk scan -> save changes
-> settings -> download clients -> + -> torrent blackhole -> torrent folder = /data/blackhole/ -> watch folder = /downloads/ -> âœ” tick save magnet files -> save
-> settings -> general -> backups (press show advanced if you cant find backups section) -> backup folder = /data/backup/ -> ok -> save changes
-> settings -> general -> api key (copy api key)
(prowlar) -> Visit prowlarr -> settings -> apps -> radarr -> prowlarr server = http://192.168.2.2:9696 -> radarr server = http://192.168.2.2:8989 -> api key (paste copied radarr api key) -> click test to confirm -> save

Step 5: Configure Jellyfin -> visit Jellyfin on your browser with http://192.168.2.2:8096
-> set language -> username -> password
-> add media library -> content type = movies -> folders = /data/movies -> configure other parts as desired -> ok
-> add media library -> content type = shows -> folders = /data/tvshows -> configure other parts as desired -> ok
-> next -> set metadata language -> set country -> next -> (optional settings) tick allow remote connections -> next -> finish

Step 6: Configure Jellyseerr -> visit jellyseerr on your browser at http://192.168.2.2:5055
-> configure jellyfin -> enter jellyfin url 192.168.2.2 (use ssl can be ticked if you have ssl setup for your arr stack) -> enter email address -> enter Jellyfin username and password -> sign in -> sync libraries -> mark desired libraries -> continue
-> Radarr settings -> add radarr server -> set server name -> set hostname or ip address (set port or leave as is for default configuration) -> tick on default server (unless otherwise needed) -> api key (visit radarr, copy radarr api key and paste here) -> click test -> choose quality profile -> click enable scan -> select root folder -> set minimum availablity -> add server
-> add sonarr server -> tick default server (unless otherwise needed) -> set server name -> set hostname or ip address -> set port or leave default for default configuration -> api key (visit sonarr, copy sonarr api key and paste here) -> click test -> set quality profile -> set root folder -> tick season foler (optional) -> tick enable scan (optional) -> add server -> optional to add override rules
(jellyseer settings) -> settings -> general -> api key (unhide api key by clicking eye icon and copy key) ... return to setup
